# 中大AUTO reg科 CUHK CUSIS AUTO REG COURSES


- python 寫, 已經轉咗做.exe
- I use python write. If you don't know how to run python, you can use my .exe file.
- `src/main.py` 有source
- Source code is in `src/main.py`. Feel free to QA. 
- 因為我之前冇SYNC 好 CUSIS TIME， 搞到次次快過CUSIS SERVER TIME，REG 科都fail 咗。
- Since I don't Sync CUSIS Server TIME in the old version, Each time Reg courses is failed. 
- 今次終於冇問題 =.='' 
- This time no problems.
